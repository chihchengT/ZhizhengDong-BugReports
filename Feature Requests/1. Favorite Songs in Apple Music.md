Apple music

**Feature Related Problem**

I want to make it easier to add my favorite songs into a playlist. 
Currently, if I want to put a song into a specific playlist for my favorites, it takes me many steps to do it: 
first, I need to open the player page for that song. Then,click on the menu button, select "Add to Playlist",
and click on the relevant playlist (and if there aren't any yet, I have to create a new playlist).

**Suggested Solution**

Create a playlist of favorite songs by default, and add a button that can add the currently playing song to this playlist directly
in the player page and the lock screen widget.

**Additional context**
 - Device: iPhone 14
 - OS: iOS 16.7.2
