**Feature Related Problem**

When I want to read the lyrics of a song that is playing, 
I need to open the lyrics page by clicking on the button on the left at the bottom of the player page.
When I want to see the list of songs that are playing, I need to click on the bottom right button. 
The placement of the buttons is not very convenient for one-handed operation.
 
**Suggested Solution**

Add gestures in the music player page. Swipe right or left in player page to open lyrics page or playlist page.
